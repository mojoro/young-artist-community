        An open-source, free-to-use directory for Young Artist Programs

        <p>
          I remember being a freshman in Boston, thinking: how do you even find all the young artist
          programs? Someone should make a site for that. Then I found out someone already had. The
          existing tools helped, but they left gaps. Program details scattered across dozens of
          websites, buried in PDFs, or locked behind paywalls. And the most valuable information of
          all, what the experience was actually like for the people who went, lived almost entirely
          in private Facebook groups and word of mouth.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn&apos;t until years later, after conservatory, after a career change, after
          learning to build software, that the thought came back differently. Maybe I could make
          something that does what the others don&apos;t.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">Why This Exists</h2>

        <p>
          Young Artist Community is a free, community-built directory of Young Artist Programs in
          classical music and opera. It exists because I believe this community deserves a single
          place to browse programs, compare details, and read honest reviews from people who&apos;ve
          been through them. No ads, no paid placements, no paywalls.
        </p>

        <p>
          The classical music world is small. The people navigating it, young singers and
          instrumentalists trying to figure out where to spend their summers, their money, and their
          energy, are making decisions that genuinely shape their careers. They should be able to
          make those decisions with good information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">What You Can Do Here</h2>

        <p>
          <strong className="text-slate-900">Browse and filter programs</strong> by instrument,
          category, location, tuition, and scholarship availability. Every listing includes the
          details that actually matter when you&apos;re deciding where to apply: what it costs,
          where it is, when the deadlines are, and what the audition process looks like.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong className="text-slate-900">Read and write reviews. </strong> If you&apos;ve
          attended a program, your experience is valuable. A five-star rating is useful. A paragraph
          about what the coaching was like, whether the housing was livable, or how the program
          treated its participants is worth more than any brochure.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong className="text-slate-900">Submit and edit program information.</strong> The site
          is built like a wiki. Anyone can add a program. Anyone can update a listing. If you notice
          something outdated or inaccurate, fix it. Every edit is versioned, so nothing is lost and
          bad information can be corrected quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong className="text-slate-900">Report problems.</strong> If something looks wrong or
          inappropriate, flag it. The community keeps this directory honest.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">
          Built by the Community, for the Community
        </h2>

        <p>
          This is not a platform run by a company trying to sell access to young musicians.
          It&apos;s a resource maintained by the people who use it. The model is simple: trust the
          community first, moderate when needed. Classical musicians, voice teachers, program
          administrators. These are thoughtful people who care about accuracy. The edit history and
          reporting system are there as safety nets, but the foundation is trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          The directory started with a handful of verified programs, each one researched and
          fact-checked against official sources. It will grow because people contribute to it.
          That&apos;s the idea.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">Where This Is Going</h2>

        <p>
          Young Artist Community starts with Young Artist Programs, but that&apos;s not where it has
          to end. Graduate programs in classical music and opera face the same information problem.
          The same scattered websites, the same reliance on word of mouth. Opening the directory to
          cover those programs is a natural next step.
        </p>

        <p>
          Verified reviews with aggregate scores would also make a real difference. Right now,
          anyone can post a review any amount of times and all of them are weighed equally. It would
          be easy to review bomb in favor of or against any program. Please, do not do this, but the
          eventual plan would be to give reviews from people confirmed to have attended a program a
          verified tag and compute their score separately. Aggregate scoring across verified alumni
          would give prospective applicants something much more reliable to work with.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this depends on community interest and involvement. The platform is built to grow
          with its users. If people show up, contribute, and find it useful, the scope grows with
          them.
        </p>

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-bold text-slate-900">Who Built This</h2>

        <p>
          My name is John Moorman. I&apos;m a software engineer based in Berlin. Before I wrote code
          for a living, I spent ten years training as an opera singer. I know this community because
          I am part of it, even if my career has taken a different route.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built this because I wanted it to exist when I was a student, and because the people
          going through that process right now deserve better tools than what&apos;s available. The
          site is free to use and will stay that way.
